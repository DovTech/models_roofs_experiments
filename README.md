# Application of models in roof segmentation
This repository contains UNet and YOLO models configured for better segmentation and detection of buildings, respectively. 
The repository also contains commits of late changes in the code of both training and testing pipelines. <br><br>

## UNet
UNet has been modified to work with RGB images and to create building masks more accurately. <br><br>

## YOLOv1
YOLOv1 represents my implementation of the YOLOv1 paper architecture. <br><br>
